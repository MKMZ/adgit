# Project Title

AdGit - web service which provides a tool to select interesting job advertisments (from website: "http://www.indeed.nl/"),
 which is matching to the experience of developer. The matching process analysis readmes from the public repositories on GitHub and analyse them.
We propose a pipeline that automatizes thisprocess and automatically suggests matching job advertisementsto developers, 
based on signals extracting from their activities onGitHub.

## Getting Started



Firstly, go to the root folder of a project and in terminal execute a command to resolve a dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Subsequently, you need to run a server. Starting it up is possible by:

```
node main.js
```


### Prerequisities

Before you will start to work with a project make sure that you have already installed Node.JS on your operating system.
Node.JS is avaiable under this website: "https://nodejs.org/en/".

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Execution of the tests can be made by

```
npm test
```
